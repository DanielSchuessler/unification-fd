=== Related Work and Prior Art ===

I first started implementing unification algorithms for the Dyna2
project where I worked with Nathaniel W. Filardo and Jason Eisner
(though this code is only loosely based on that work). The two-level
types approach was adapted from Tim Sheard[1]; the idea of functional
pointers were independently discovered by Dijkstra et al.[2] after
their apperance in Dyna2; Edward Kmett pointed out the weighted
extension to path compression (popular in the union--find literature);
and the functor coproduct code is adapted from Wouter Swierstra[3].
