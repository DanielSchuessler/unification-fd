Debugging:
    * Create a test suite to be sure of correctness & usability.
    * Combine the test suite into a single executable and then do:
        $> darcs setpref test "runhaskell Tests.hs"
    * Also, tell Setup.hs so that `cabal test` and `runhaskell
      Setup.hs test` call the test suite.

Enhancements:
    * Add a fast occurs check for looking at the whole binding state (outside of unifications)

Sooner than later:
    * Proper benchmarking. Especially for the union--find enhancement

Eventually:
    * Antiunification?
    * Disunification?
    * Higher-rank unification (in a way that generalizes over contravariance and im/predicativity issues)?
    * Typed unification? (is there a clean way to do it without HList-style hackery?)
