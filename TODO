Debugging:
    * Create a test suite to be sure of correctness & usability.
    * Combine the test suite into a single executable and then do:
        $> darcs setpref test "runhaskell Tests.hs"
    * Also, tell Setup.hs so that `cabal test` and `runhaskell
      Setup.hs test` call the test suite.

Enhancements:
    * Finish implementing aggressive observable sharing
    * Implement weighted-union ala union--find

Sooner than later:

Eventually:
    * Move old code to ./test/ or ./experiments/ or something
